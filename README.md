# Pathfinder-Die-Roller
A GUI for rolling different types of dice

I will be taking my Calcuator assignment and change the number inputs to Die rollers. 2,4,6,8,10,12,20

To run the GUI you will need to import randint from random.
For some of the functionallity we are looking foward to also import Tkinter and Math. 

Future Functionality:
Make the keyboard inputs work in the display input; currently the GUI can only make a random roll once with a keystroke but will not rerandomize on the second stroke but be stored as the first random integer.

Look into adding DC (dificulty class) input to caluate success or failure.

Rolling multple rolls at once and display total.
