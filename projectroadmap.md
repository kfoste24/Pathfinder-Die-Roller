1. Change buttons from digits to random number generators. Change the characters to run a randint instead of a fixed number. **DONE**

2. Change the lambda event characters to random numbers for using a keyboard to enter into the GUI. **DONE**

3. Delete unnecessary buttons. Left with die rolls for D2, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, D100, addition button, sum button, backspace, clear. **DONE**

4. Colorize the buttons. Make it clear and easy to tell what is where. **DONE**

5. Change the fonts of the buttons to correspond with the color **DONE**

6. Resize the buttons to be square. **DONE**

7. Relocate the sum to span the GUI **DONE**

8. Make a function to read if the input line is empty or not and put an addition sign in if there is already a roll in the input line. **PARTIAL** have the function inserting the addition sign, but cant not figure out how to check if the self.entry is empty

9. Make the function replace the randint after the lambda event from using the keyboard. Need to be able to use the keys to make unique rolls and not have the same result each press. **PARTIAL** Made a function that rolls using the lambda events but still can not get keystrokes to yield different outcomes.

10. Edit the Project Road Map to fir the project specs. **DONE**
